* Making an OpenGL Window with GLFW

In this side quest we will show how to make a simple window using the
GLFW library and how to load OpenGL with GLAD (https://glad.dav1d.de/).

I generated GLAD bindings from the web page on Ubuntu 20.04 using the
OpenGL specification Core profile for C++. This is saved in the
~cdeps~ folder.

I use the ~guix~ package manager to install the latest version of glfw
as specified in the ~dev.manifest.scm~ into a local profile under
~_guix/dev~.

The load paths for glfw are then hardcoded to this.

You must then compile the glad bindings:

#+begin_src sh
  make build
#+end_src

Then you can run the ~src/main.sc~ module.

#+begin_src sh
  scopes src/main.sc
#+end_src
