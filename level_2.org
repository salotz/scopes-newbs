** Level 2: Things you would know if you knew C/C++

*** TODO More Strings

*** TODO Arrays


*** Including C Functions

You can load a single function:

#+begin_src scopes :tangle _bin/externc1.sc
  let printf =
      do
          let header = (include "stdio.h")
          header.extern.printf

  printf "hello\n"
#+end_src


Or a whole module:

#+begin_src scopes :tangle _bin/externc2.sc
  let c:stdio =
      (include "stdio.h") . extern

  c:stdio.printf "hello\n"
#+end_src

Note that ~c:stdio~ is just a symbol and not special syntax. It could
have been: ~stdio~ or any other valid symbol.


If you have a newer version it is also included in the standard
library:

#+begin_src scopes :tangle _bin/externc2.sc
  let c:stdio = (import C.stdio)
  let c:string = (import C.string)
  let c:stdlib = (import C.stdlib)
#+end_src


*** TODO Pattern Matching

See ~match~


** Level 3: For Lisp/Scheme Gurus

In this section we will cover the features that are similar to Lisp
and Scheme like languages.

Scopes is after all a Scheme-like language.


** Level 4: Going super-saiyan, Scopes trick-shots
