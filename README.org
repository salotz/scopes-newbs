* Scopes Language

** Exploratory Functionality

On the REPL the help command can tell you the signature of functions:

#+begin_src scopes
  help print
#+end_src


** Basic Control Flow

*** Loops

The fundamental loop in scopes is very general, but maybe not exactly
what you are used to from a langauge like Python.

Scopes does provide these comfy loops though and its very satisfying.

**** For-Loop

Here is a basic for loop like you would find in python:

#+begin_src scopes :tangle _bin/loop_range-forloop.sc
  for i in (range 10)
      print i
#+end_src


You can loop over the language level lists, but they need to be
"quoted" by placing a single apostrophe ~'~ at the beginning of the
list just like in other Scheme languages. Otherwise it will try to
call the function ~0~ on arguments ~1~ and ~2~.

#+begin_src scopes :tangle _bin/loop_forloop.sc
  for i in '(0 1 2)
      print i
#+end_src
